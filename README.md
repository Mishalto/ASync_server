# Asynchronous Server
The server is designed to receive and display messages.  
Operations are non-blocking, so a large number of messages can be received simultaneously.

With Boost.Asio

## Controls
1. Start the server.  
2. Connect to the server via Telnet.  
3. Send requests.  

## Build
1. Make sure you have CMake, Git, and a release version of CMake installed.  
2. Open the project folder.  
3. CMake will automatically pull all required dependencies, and the project will be ready (this process may take a very long time).
